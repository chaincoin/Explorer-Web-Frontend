    Real-Time
        getdifficulty - Current difficulty target as a decimal number
        getblockcount - Current block height in the longest chain
        latesthash - Hash of the latest block
        bcperblock - Current block reward in BTC
        totalbc - Total Bitcoins in circulation (delayed by up to 1 hour])
        probability - Probability of finding a valid block each hash attempt
        hashestowin - Average number of hash attempts needed to solve a block
        nextretarget - Block height of the next difficulty retarget
        avgtxsize - Average transaction size for the past 1000 blocks. Change the number of blocks by passing an integer as the second argument e.g. avgtxsize/2000
        avgtxvalue - Average transaction value (1000 Default)
        interval - average time between blocks in seconds
        eta - estimated time until the next block (in seconds)
        avgtxnumber - Average number of transactions per block (100 Default)

    Address Lookups
        To filter by x number of confirmations include the confirmations parameter

        e.g. /q/addressbalance/1EzwoHtiXB4iFwedPr49iywjZn2nnekhoj?confirmations=6
        to only include transactions with 6 or more confirmations. This is extremely important if you are processing valuable transactions.
        getreceivedbyaddress/Address - Get the total number of bitcoins received by an address (in satoshi). Multiple addresses separated by | Do not use to process payments without the confirmations parameter
        Add the parameters start_time and end_time to restrict received by to a specific time period. Provided times should be a unix timestamp in milliseconds. Multiple addresses separated by |

        getsentbyaddress/Address - Get the total number of bitcoins send by an address (in satoshi). Multiple addresses separated by | Do not use to process payments without the confirmations parameter
        addressbalance/Address - Get the balance of an address (in satoshi). Multiple addresses separated by | Do not use to process payments without the confirmations parameter
        addressfirstseen/Address - Timestamp of the block an address was first confirmed in.

    Transaction Lookups
        txtotalbtcoutput/TxHash - Get total output value of a transaction (in satoshi)
        txtotalbtcinput/TxHash - Get total input value of a transaction (in satoshi)
        txfee/TxHash - Get fee included in a transaction (in satoshi)
        txresult/TxHash/Address - Calculate the result of a transaction sent or received to Address. Multiple addresses separated by |
        
    Tools
        addresstohash/Address - Converts a bitcoin address to a hash 160
        hashtoaddress/Hash - Converts a hash 160 to a bitcoin address
        hashpubkey/Pubkey - Converts a public key to a hash 160
        addrpubkey/Pubkey - Converts a public key to an Address
        pubkeyaddr/Address - Converts an address to public key (if available)
